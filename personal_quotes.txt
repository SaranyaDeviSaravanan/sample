Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. ...
If you're going through hell, keep going. ...
A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week. ...
Quality is not an act, it is a habit

"A book is a garden, an orchard, a storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude of counselors." â€“ Charles Baudelaire
